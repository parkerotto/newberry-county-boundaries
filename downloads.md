### Notes on generalizations
#### GIS Files
The Full files contain all the detail incorporated in the original state boundary files. The generalized versions of the US historical boundary files contain the counties and state/territories but the detail of the boundary lines has been reduced using algorithms incorporated in ESRI software. 

#### KMZ Files
KMZ files for the US are provided both with and without Alaska & Hawaii.
The following chart shows the approximate scale at which the generalization becomes noticeable on map polygons:

| File | Scale |
| Generalized .0001 deg. tolerance | 1:25,000 |
| Generalized .001 deg. tolerance | 1:250,000 | 
| Generalized .01 deg. tolerance | 1:2,500,000 | 
| Generalized .05 deg. tolerance | 1:12,500,000 |
