## How to Use the Atlas
The *Atlas of Historical County Boundaries* is meant to be a resource for people seeking records of past events, and people trying to analyze, interpret and display county-based historical data like returns of elections and censuses, and for people working on state and local history projects. The special interests of those potential users range from history to demography, economics, genealogy, geography, law, and politics.

The data used in the Atlas project is readily available to download to be consulted, reviewed, and reused for any lawful purpose, commercial or non-commercial, without licensing or permission fees to the library. Please note that some files may contain the original, out-of-date copyright license; these can be ignored.
